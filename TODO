Rework buffered_socket

- Shouldn't be buffered_socket but buffered_reader operating on generic
  io_channel
- buffered_read_until and buffered_read_exactly should have exaclty the
  same semantics if read_function was called from the event loop, so no
  return value but calling of error callback routines.

An io_channel should have:
- a writev() and a read() function
- a context for read() and writev() to operate on
- maybe a read callback routine, a write callback routine and a error
  callback routine that might be set from outside (see last paragraph).

Clarify ALL return values of all buffered_reader functions (internal and
external)


What about connecting only io_channels with the eventloop wo that the
whole buffered_reader stuff does not need to know anything about the
event_loop?
