- fetcher/setter search with radix/prefix/patricia trie
- probably HAT-trie
- write unit test to ensure that when performing a fetch the add events come before the fetch response.
- implement jet.FetchOnly (read-only states, set not allowed)
- uuid.c is too simple. It generates number wich can easily clash with numbers coming from peers. A concatenation of peer id and a uuid would be o.k.
